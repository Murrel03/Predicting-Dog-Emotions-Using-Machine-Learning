# Predicting-Dog-Emotions-Using-Machine-Learning
Nowadays, there are plenty of machine learning projects focused on image
recognition and caption generation. Great chunk of it is about recognizing human
face and naming emotion it express. We decided to build image recognition with
emotion capture, not for human faces though, but for dog’s muzzles, as there is
no good model to do that yet and far more fun. Our application is able to
determine a dog’s emotional state visually with an accuracy between 56% and
60%, exceeding human capability to recognize dog emotions.


# Dogs Emotion Dataset
The dataset used for the project was found in Kaggle with the name
“doggos_emotion_recognition”, which contains around 2000 images
belonging to four classes ie, train, test and validation, containg four
emotions :-
• happy dogs - dogs with the smile, mainly with open muzzle and
tongue out
• angry dogs - dogs that looks scary, with their teeth showing
• sleepy dogs - dogs that are taking a nap, or are about to, with closed
or squinted eyes,
• good dogs - dogs that looks polite, with neutral muzzle
