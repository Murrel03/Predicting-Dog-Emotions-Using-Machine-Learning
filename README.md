# Predicting-Dog-Emotions-Using-Machine-Learning
Nowadays, there are plenty of machine learning projects focused on image
recognition and caption generation. Great chunk of it is about recognizing human
face and naming emotion it express. We decided to build image recognition with
emotion capture, not for human faces though, but for dog’s muzzles, as there is
no good model to do that yet and far more fun. Our application is able to
determine a dog’s emotional state visually with an accuracy between 56% and
60%, exceeding human capability to recognize dog emotions.
